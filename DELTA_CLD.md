# Claude Messages API compliance TODO

Last review: 2026-09-18 (Anthropic Go SDK v1.71.0)

Open items for `POST /v1/messages` and `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens`
against the Anthropic Messages reference. Each item is a gap; nothing that
already works is listed in the checklist. Priorities: **P0** wrong answer or silent 200,
**P1** gap on an otherwise supported path, **P2** missing feature.

## Recent-release review

Reviewed the [release notes](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/release-notes/overview)
through September 18 and the linked feature guides, including betas. September
18 only adds Compliance API coverage and does not change the inference adapter.

Every inference request follows wire format → `pkg/provider` → target provider.
There is no Claude passthrough or raw-request context hook. Compaction and
reasoning reuse their existing shared types. Scoped system guidance uses one
`Content.Instructions` part containing `Text` and `Scope`.

Implemented and tested:

- On-demand and threshold compaction retain the existing trigger/threshold
  abstraction and signature scoping.
- `tools[].strict` maps to the existing `provider.Tool.Strict`. Each backend
  uses its existing schema support (Gemini uses validated function calling;
  Bedrock support depends on the model).
- Per-message effort uses `ConfigurationUpdate.ReasoningEffort`. Supported
  Claude models and OpenAI Responses retain positional updates. Other Claude
  models, Chat Completions, Gemini, Bedrock, and xAI resolve the latest update
  into the next request's effort without changing the caller's history.
  This fallback does not preserve positional caching guarantees.
- Backend thinking and signatures are returned for model defaults as well as
  explicit thinking requests, over HTTP and SSE. Signature-only blocks include
  an empty `thinking` string. Reported thinking token counts are preserved.
- Hosted tool search round-trips through existing `ToolCall`/`ToolResult`
  parts, including loaded definitions and call/result order. Claude and OpenAI
  use native discovery; Chat Completions, Gemini, Bedrock Converse, and xAI
  expose the catalog as normal tools and omit completed hosted search events.
  Client-executed search remains a callable function on fallback providers.
- `clear_at: next_user_message` maps to `Instructions` with turn scope.
  Supported Claude models retain the original messages and native beta; other
  providers omit expired instructions without mutating the source history.
  A client tool-result message expires the instruction; hosted search does not.
- `clear_thinking_20251015` maps supported keep-all / one-thinking-turn values
  to the existing reasoning context setting.
- Optional unknown fields and provider hints remain best effort. Trailing JSON,
  missing required fields, invalid enum values, unsupported semantic controls,
  and forced tool choice on Fable/Mythos 5.1 and Opus 5.5 return explicit
  errors (Claude API and Bedrock).

Unsupported semantic controls still return errors: tool additions/removals,
thinking display `updates`, explicit binding controls, task budgets, custom
compaction instructions/pause, and unsupported context edits. Cache markers/TTL,
`top_p`, `top_k`, and `metadata` are accepted as optional hints but are not
preserved across providers. Automatic Claude caching remains enabled.
Computer/browser toolsets remain unsupported; legacy computer tools still work.
Opus 5.5 accepts only the toolset, so legacy computer tools fail upstream there.

Claude Files/Skills, hosted code execution, advisor, and MCP connector support
would be separate feature work. Managed Agents and administrative endpoints are
outside the current inference adapter's scope. The separate Anthropic research
provider already uses hosted web search and code execution; that does not expose
those tools through `POST /v1/messages`.

## Request validation

- [ ] P1 Validate `budget_tokens` and sampling ranges.
- [ ] P1 Validate mid-conversation `role: "system"` placement and model support.
- [ ] P2 Support tool additions/removals through shared conversation state.
      Tool-change blocks are currently rejected; scoped instructions are supported.
      See [mid-conversation system messages](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages).
- [ ] P1 Confirm or reject `max_tokens: 0` per backend (forwarded verbatim).
- [ ] P2 Return an Anthropic error body on authentication failure (bare 401
      today).

## Request fields

- [ ] P2 Honor additional request options where a shared concept is useful:
      top-level `cache_control`, `fallbacks`,
      `fallback_credit_token`, `container`, `inference_geo`, `speed`,
      `diagnostics`, `mcp_servers`, `service_tier`,
      `output_config.task_budget`.
      [Task budgets](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/task-budgets)
      are advisory across an agentic loop; they are not equivalent to the
      existing per-request `MaxTokens`.
- [ ] P2 Validate `anthropic-beta` and `anthropic-version`; honor
      `anthropic-user-profile-id`.

## Thinking

- [ ] P2 Support progress updates through shared commentary events; the
      `thinking.display: "updates"` control is currently rejected.
- [ ] P1 Support `thinking.block_binding` and report `input_transformations`;
      the explicit control is currently rejected.
      [Prefix binding](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/preserved-thinking)
      is enforced by default for Fable 5.1 on newer accounts. Hosted search
      replay now retains search blocks and unchanged tool declarations and has
      passed live Fable 5.1 replay. Explicit binding-policy selection and its
      diagnostics are still unsupported.
- [ ] P1 Preserve a fixed `budget_tokens` for Claude backends instead of a
      coarse effort (Claude 4.5 and older receive no thinking at all).

## Cache control

- [ ] P2 Design shared cache policy if explicit placement/TTL is needed.
      Explicit markers/TTL are currently ignored; the Claude adapter's
      automatic top-level caching remains enabled.

## Context management

- [ ] P1 Support `compact_*` `instructions` and `pause_after_compaction`
      (explicitly rejected; common trigger/threshold compaction is supported).
- [ ] P1 Report applied edits (`context_management` in the response and
      `message_delta`).
- [ ] P2 Support `clear_tool_uses_*` and arbitrary thinking retention counts.
      Keep-all and one-thinking-turn retention already use shared reasoning context.

## Input content

- [ ] P1 Round-trip hosted web-search/fetch calls and results through shared
      tool history. Hosted tool-search calls/results already round-trip.
- [ ] P2 Accept `search_result`, `mcp_tool_use`, `mcp_tool_result`,
      `container_upload`, `mid_conv_system`, `fallback`, `tool_addition`,
      `tool_removal`, advisor / code-execution result blocks,
      and `source.type: "file"` / `"content"` (all rejected with a field
      path today).
- [ ] P2 Support document `context`, `title`, `citations`; text `citations`;
      image transformations.

## Tools

- [ ] P2 Add `eager_input_streaming`, `allowed_callers`, `cache_control`,
      `input_examples`.
- [ ] P2 Support [computer](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/computer-use-tool)
      and [browser](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/browser-use-tool)
      `*_toolset_20260801` (rejected today). SDK v1.71.0 already has both types;
      support requires changes to the common conversion path. It must include
      member configuration, `toolset_name` on calls/results, and browser-state
      results, not just accepting the tool definition. Legacy computer use is
      still supported upstream, so this is an optional migration.
- [ ] P2 Support or keep rejecting code execution, memory, web search / fetch,
      advisor, MCP toolsets.
- [ ] P2 Honor variant-specific options on built-in tools.

## Response object

- [ ] P1 Emit `container`, `context_management`, `diagnostics` (null when
      unused).
- [ ] P1 Emit `usage.cache_creation` breakdown, `iterations`,
      `server_tool_use`, `service_tier`, `inference_geo`, `speed`,
      `fallback_credit`.
- [ ] P1 Emit `stop_details.fallback_credit_token`,
      `fallback_has_prefill_claim`, `recommended_model`.
- [ ] P1 Emit `citations` on text blocks (empty array when none).
- [ ] P2 Emit the server / MCP / container / fallback result blocks
      (`web_search_tool_result`, `web_fetch_tool_result`,
      `advisor_tool_result`, `code_execution_tool_result`,
      `bash_code_execution_tool_result`,
      `text_editor_code_execution_tool_result`,
      `mcp_tool_use`, `mcp_tool_result`, `container_upload`, `fallback`).
- [ ] P2 Emit assistant-generated files.
- [ ] P2 Add `request-id` and workspace response headers.

## Stop sequences

- [ ] P1 Report the matched `stop_sequence` value on Bedrock (Converse does
      not return it).
- [ ] P1 Report `stop_reason: "stop_sequence"` for Gemini backends (Gemini
      finishes with `STOP`; the sequence is applied but not signalled).

## Streaming

- [ ] P1 Emit `citations_delta`, `thinking_delta.estimated_tokens`,
      `message_delta.context_management`, `message_delta.delta.container`.
- [ ] P1 Report `input_tokens` in `message_start` for non-Anthropic backends
      (currently `0` until `message_delta`).
- [ ] P2 Emit `ping`.

## count_tokens

- [ ] P2 Use the backend's tokenizer where available instead of the local
      estimate.

## Tests to add

- [ ] Thinking-display and explicit binding-policy controls.
- [ ] Fable 5.1 replay with explicit strict binding enforcement. Default-policy
      signed tool-search replay is covered by the live cross-provider matrix.
- [ ] `max_tokens: 0` across backends.
- [ ] Wire-shape fixtures (JSON and SSE) for every stop reason and for
      envelope / usage field presence.

## Proposed shared design for remaining features

Keep provider API structs at the server/provider boundaries. Add common fields
only for semantics every adapter can either implement or explicitly reject.

1. **Tool availability:** extend conversation updates with active tool names.
   A common resolver can compute the current catalog for adapters without
   positional controls; capable adapters can retain the original events.
   Instruction lifetime already follows this pattern through `Instructions`.
2. **Tool collections:** reuse `Tool.Tools`, namespaces, and normal tool
   calls/results. Define computer/browser member schemas and a portable browser
   state result. Providers with built-in toolsets can compile these to native
   definitions; others use function tools with the same member identities and
   executor. Preserve ordered execution and stop-on-error behavior.
3. **Other hosted tools and progress:** extend the same `ToolCall`/`ToolResult`
   path used by tool search, and represent progress through shared commentary
   events. Both API frontends must round-trip a feature's complete history.
4. **Budgets, cache, and binding:** put a total task budget in shared agent-loop
   accounting, separate from per-response `MaxTokens`. Treat cache policy and
   invalid reasoning state as capability-aware adapter policies. Report any
   dropped state through common diagnostics if that becomes a product requirement.

Tool availability changes, toolsets, progress/binding controls, and total task
budgets above are proposals, not implemented support.

## Review verification

`server/anthropic/features_e2e_test.go` exercises the real API handlers, shared
representation, signature adapter, and SDK request/response conversion with
mocked upstream transports. Its matrix covers both Messages and Responses with
Claude (positional and fallback), OpenAI Responses and Chat, Gemini, xAI, and
Bedrock. It checks current effort, accompanying instructions, strict-tool
conversion, default-thinking HTTP/SSE replay, and explicit unsupported errors.

`test/anthropic/features/release_e2e_test.go` passed against the real Claude API
on September 18: default-thinking HTTP and SSE, signed second-turn replay, and
strict-tool execution with effort changes before and after the tool call.
Run it with `CLAUDE_RELEASE_LIVE=1`.

Its scoped-instruction cases also passed over HTTP and SSE: temporary German
guidance applies to one answer; the next user turn can again use English while
the original instruction and signed assistant output remain in the transcript.

Compaction and mid-conversation instruction live coverage remains in
`test/anthropic/features/context_e2e_test.go`, gated by `CLAUDE_CONTEXT_LIVE=1`.

`server/anthropic/toolsearch_e2e_test.go` checks HTTP/SSE hosted-search replay
between Claude and OpenAI through both API frontends, including null OpenAI
hosted call IDs, loaded schemas, deferred flags, and implicit namespaces. It also
checks fallback replay on Chat, Gemini, xAI, and Bedrock using mocked transports.
`instructions_e2e_test.go` checks native/fallback instruction lifetimes over
HTTP/SSE across seven adapters and acceptance of optional provider hints.

`TOOL_SEARCH_LIVE=1 go test ./test/anthropic/features -run TestToolSearchCrossProviderLive -v`
passed on September 18: 54 replay cases across Claude Opus 5, Claude Fable 5.1,
and GPT-5.4, using Messages and Responses over HTTP/SSE. Responses also covers
namespaced tools. Each case discovers a deferred tool, replays the complete
output with a client tool result to the target model, and verifies its final
answer. These use real upstream APIs and local Wingman handlers.
